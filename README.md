### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-✔️ View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-✔️ See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-✔️ Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
-✔️ Upvote and downvote comments
-❌ **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
-❌ **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

- Built a <template> for the comments and other containers like for useroptions <button>. Grab a template whenever it satisfies a condition.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- First time I learned <template>. On my previous works, I would just set the elements with "display: none", and clone that element but its selected for when <querySelector> is used. With <template>, I do not need to worry about such problems.


### Continued development

Unfortunately I've ran out of motivation on doing this project. I finished what I could finish and I just want to move to another project.
